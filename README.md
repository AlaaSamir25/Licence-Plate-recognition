# Licence Plate Recognnition In Real Time
This project focuses on implementing an algorithm for license plate recognition, employing three state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv8, SSD, and Faster-RCNN. These models have been carefully selected to ensure high performance in detecting license plates.

During the inference phase, we conducted extensive testing using the three models on two videos. One video featured a camera placed in close proximity to the cars, while the other video captured footage from a non-close vantage point. This comprehensive evaluation allowed us to assess the models' effectiveness in various scenarios.
